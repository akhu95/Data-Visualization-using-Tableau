## 🧭 Overview  
This Tableau project presents an end-to-end **Vehicle Insurance Claim Analysis** highlighting customer risk segmentation, claim severity, and potential financial exposure.  
It transforms raw policy data into **interactive, insight-driven dashboards** to help insurance stakeholders identify **loss-heavy customer segments** and **strengthen underwriting strategies**.

---

## 💼 Business Problem  
Insurance companies often struggle to predict claim severity and identify policyholders who pose a **high financial risk**.  
This analysis addresses the question:  
> “Which customer and vehicle profiles drive the greatest claim losses, and how can we proactively reduce exposure?”

## 🔑 Key Insights  

| # | Finding | Impact |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | **1,150 of 7,647 customers (15%)** are classified as high-claim risk | Drives **$21M** in past claims |
| 2 | High-risk customers caused **$9M total loss** over 5 years | Indicates overexposure in certain segments |
| 3 | **Potential loss of $5.83M** if current claims are approved | Urgent review required |
| 4 | **Super Senior Citizens (>80 yrs)** have the highest average loss per claim (~$8.7K) | Age-based risk evident |
| 5 | **Van, Minivan, and Sports Car** owners lead high claim severity | Vehicle-type risk patterns |
| 6 | **Female Sports Car** and **Male Van** drivers dominate high-loss segments | Targeted premium review suggested |
